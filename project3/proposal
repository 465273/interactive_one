    <h1><code>Not So Convenient Updates
    </h1>
        <p>Social media platforms and network services are used by up to millions of
        users everyday. To make sure that users have the best experiences and are
        satisfied with their engagements, the service often pushes updates that they
        believe will enhance the quality and make their program easier to use. Sometimes
        however, things do not go so well and concepts totally backfire when users
        actually engage with a certain update.
      </p>
        <p>Popular social media networks and apps used for engagements and user friendly
        communities such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat have all
        had these not so successful moments, Snapchat having the most recent incident
        with its confusing update by combining 2 sections of the app with different
        functions into one very hard to navigate page.
      </p>
        <p>One of the most well known/ infamous updates that these social media networks
        have added is the algorithm based feeds or newsfeeds. Instead of displaying
        posts in the original default chronological order, Facebook and Instagram
        (following soon after) decided that it would be better for users to see posts
        from users and pages that they thought had the most relevance to the owner of
        the account and almost completely ignore the posts of other users that the
        owner would not usually interact with.

        <p>wait why tf am i writing an essay lol
        </p>
        <p>concept in mind: since these social media networks and apps all have
          scrolling, maybe try to reflect that with the webpage and somehow add
          two versions, one with the previous better version and the other one
          pointing out what is wrong and why so many users are against it.
          If scrolling doesn't work, make a visual comparison putting before and
          after side x side and analyzing wtf is wrong.
