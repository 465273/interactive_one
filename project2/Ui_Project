  <span style="font-size:35pt"><code>History of Menu Icons</span></div><br><br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Computers and Operating Systems)
  <h3><p style="color:orange"><div id="One"><code>Menu icons are graphic elements
    that have functions that lead to a more <br>specific tool of a home menu page.
    Some of the most widely used menu icons <br>that we know of today are the
    hamburger icon, settings icon, the home icon, <br>and the chat/mail icon.</div></p></h3>

    <p><div id="Three"><code>Icons were first introduced around the 1980s
      by a computer called <br>the Xerox 8010 Star. Invented by Dr. David Smith and
      designed by <br>Norm Cox, this mathematician and artist made the first square
      grid <br>icons on the colorless desktop which led to the icons we see today.
 </div></p>
        <div id="Four"><code>Around 1985, the
        icons were starting to become more than just flat symbols, <br>like the file
        drawers or the trash icon. Also around the same time, color <br>became a
        thing. Icons were stepping outside the boundaries of black and white <br>as
        technology improved and evolved. The computer Amiga introduced and
        enabled <br>a setting where users were able to customize the icons with 4
        colors and <br>several different sizes.
</div>
      <p><div id="Five"><code>In 1989, Steve Jobs’s newer operating
        system named “neXTSTEP” was introduced. <br>The icons in this program had
        shading and more detailed designs, which were <br>the first to have
        skeuomorphism.

      </div><p>
      <p style="color:cyan"><div id="Six"><code>Entering the 90s,
        the icons started to become looking more organized and <br>intrusive.
        Isometric designs were used more often and solid accents were put <br>in.
        Different companies also decided to take a unique turn in their designs
        <br>and made something different from everyone else. In 1993, a computer
        called <br>the “Geoworks Ensemble 2” by Geoworks decided to be one of those
        first companies <br>to move away from the mainstream style by making most
        of the icons into a teal <br>color as the main colorway, instead for going
        all out with using as many colors <br>as possible.
</div></p>

      <p><span style="font-size:20pt"><div id="Seven"><code>Another unique
        style was designed by the BeOS in 1997, where all the icons <br>were made
        to have a cubic shape as their base design.
</div></span>

      <p><span style="font-size:20pt"><div id="Eight"><code>And in 1998,
        designers were pushing hard to make their vector icons stand out <br>using
        lowkey illusionism, some making their menu icons look like it’s floating.
</div></span>

      <p><span style="font-size:20pt"><div id="Nine"><code>Starting from
        the new era in 2000, the styles of the icons finally became to be <br>the
        realistic icons that we mostly see today. The hyper realistic photo
        illustrative <br>icons were first seen on the iconic Windows XP and the Mac
        OS X.
</div></span>

      <p><span style="font-size:20pt"><div id="Ten"><code>Jumping all the
        way to mid 2007, the glossy icons came to handheld devices, <br>with the
        introduction to the first ever version of the ISO. Android and other
        <br>phones followed the lead soon after but around 2010-12, designers
        started to <br>backtrack with the realistic design and started to go back
        to simple and flat <br>illustrations with as few as 2 colors used.
</div></span>

      <p><span style="font-size:20pt"><div id="Eleven"><code>Now in 2018, we
        still do see realistic icons, but most of these menu buttons still <br>go
        with the simplicity of the flat designs.
</div></span>
